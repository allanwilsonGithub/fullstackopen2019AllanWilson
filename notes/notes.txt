JSX
The layout of React components is mostly written using JSX. Although JSX looks like HTML, we are actually dealing with a way to write JavaScript.
Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.

root component called App at the top of the component tree of the application

React component names must be capitalized : 'footer' not good. 'Footer' good

A React component (usually) needs to contain one root element. Example the component App needs an enclosing div-element wrapping everything.
This can be avoided by using fragments, i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element: <>  < />

Browsers do not yet support all of Javascript's newest features. Due to this fact, a lot of code run in browsers has been transpiled from a newer version of Javascript to an older, more compatible version.
Today, the most popular way to do the transpiling is using Babel

Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment based on Google's chrome V8 Javascript engine

in this course we avoid issues by using the "this-less" Javascript.

There are several mechanisms by which the original this can be preserved. One of these is using a method called bind:

When the state modifying function setCounter is called, React re-renders the component which means that the function body of the component function gets re-executed:

LEARN: React Hooks: usestate / useEffect

conditional rendering (based on state)

STATE:
Hooks may only be called from the inside of a function body that defines a React component:

const App = (props) => {
  // these are ok
  const [age, setAge] = useState(0)
  const [name, setName] = useState('Juha Tauriainen')

  if ( age > 10 ) {
    // this does not work!
    const [foobar, setFoobar] = useState(null)
  }

DEBUGGING:
console.log()
Chrome developer console's debugger, by writing the command debugger anywhere in your code.
new React developer tools tab can be used to inspect the different React elements in the application, along with their state and props (Components and profiler tabs)
