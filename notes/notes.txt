JSX
The layout of React components is mostly written using JSX. Although JSX looks like HTML, we are actually dealing with a way to write JavaScript.
Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.

root component called App at the top of the component tree of the application

React component names must be capitalized : 'footer' not good. 'Footer' good

A React component (usually) needs to contain one root element. Example the component App needs an enclosing div-element wrapping everything.
This can be avoided by using fragments, i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element: <>  < />
